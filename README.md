# Semantic HTML


This repository is just a practice for applying my knowledge with semantic HTML.


Each directory will be a clone of a website without CSS and Javascript.

Something like this https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/


## Notes

You should use a tag because of its meaning, not because of its default style.

An `h1` tag can look very small if you change its default styling through CSS but its meaning will
always be the same -- that it's one of the important parts of the current page.

Give a design to 10 developers and you will get 10 different code versions.

What that just means is that there's no right or wrong when doing frontend work


--

<article> tags should include <h1>-<h6> as a child of the article element
